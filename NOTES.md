## Clone Repo

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/worldsibu/convector-example-people-attributes.git
$ cd convector-example-people-attributes
```

## Config environment

`.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/node_modules/": true,
    // The following will hide the js and map files in the editor
    "**/*.js": true,
    "**/*.map": true
  }
}
```

`.vscode/launch.json`

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Attach to Backend Server",
      "port": 9222,
      "sourceMaps": true,
      "trace" : true
    },
    {
      "type": "node",

      "trace" : true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Install/Update Tooling

check versions

```shell
$ hurl --version
1.0.5
$ nest --version
6.5.0
$ node --version
v8.16.0
```

> Note: tried first with `node/v11.10.0` but gives some errors with `node-gyp`, changed to `node/v8.16.0` with nvh and everything works with `npm i`

## SetUp

1. Install/Update Hurley which will help us to set up a testing network `npm i -g @worldsibu/hurley`

2. Install/Update the NestJS CLI by running `npm install -g @nestjs/cli`

3. Recreate repo with `rm .git -r && git init`

4. Run `rm -rf ./packages/server` to delete Express App.

5. Edit `.gitignore`

6. Move to the package folder run `cd packages && nest new server && cd ..`. This is going to scaffold a NestJS project for you.

7. Install `env-cmd` with lerna for handle environmental variables `npx lerna add env-cmd --dev --scope server --no-bootstrap`

8. Install the smart contract packages that are going to be consumed by NestJS


```shell
$ npx lerna add participant-cc --scope server --no-bootstrap
$ npx lerna add person-cc --scope server --no-bootstrap
```

> To avoid typing conflicts add the `skipLibCheck` flag in the `root` and `server` `tsconfig` files.
> (There is a problem between Jest used by NestJS and Mocha used by Convector)

9. And lastly `npm install`

## What are we going to build?

We‚Äôre going to re-use the **two smart contracts** that were created in the smart-contract tutorial and expose them through endpoints using NestJS.

### Here is a brief explanation of what it is done in the smart contract tutorial

There are three data structures in the blockchain: **Network Participants, Attribute and Person**.

#### Each data structure is defined as

- **Network Participants**: These are the companies issuing attributes in the network. They are responsible for what they state for users and are identifiable in the network.
- **Attribute**: It‚Äôs the statement that a Network Participant certifies for a Person.
- **Person**: These are the people representation in the network. They have attributes assigned and can simply query them as needed to certify in front of a third party.

#### Business rules

- Create a person should be responsibility of just one organization ‚Äî the government.
- Each organization (network participant) should be able to issue or certify attributes.
- Each organization (network participant) should be able to check/query attributes from a person.
- A single ID should be enough to query all the information related to one person and his attributes.
- Only the organization that certifies an attribute can edit it.

#### The flow should look like this

- The government can ‚Äúenroll‚Äù a new person.
- The government can add some attributes to that person by default.
- Then, other organizations can start to issue attributes (profession, insurance status, work experience).
- Every change in the attributes issued will be evident. Changes on attributes can only be performed by the organization that issued them in the first place.

Let take a look to the following example to understand better:

Assume that a network participant is the **government**, a person is you and an attribute your born certificate.
The government is in charge of **registering your birth day and issue a born certificate** that you‚Äôll store.
But for some reason your name have a typo (I‚Äôm sorry for you üòÇ) in the certificate and only the county court (another network participant that is not the government) can help you. The county court can **fix your name but not create another person**.
